# Techdegree-Project-8
 My 8th Techdegree Project
 
This project is a web application that uses the SQL technology to communicate with, and manage, the books database of a library.
The project was built with the SQLite and Sequelize dependencies in Express.
A "Book" model is synchronized to the database, to access the collection of 15 books.
In the web app, books can be updated or deleted, and new books can be created.
All the pages are rendered with pug views, and accessed via various routes set up in the "routes" folder.

The app is launched by typing "npm install" into the terminal, followed by "npm start".
